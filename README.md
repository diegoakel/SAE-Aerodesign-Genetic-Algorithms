# SAE Aerodesign Genetic Algorithms

This is a Wing optimization Genetic Algorithm implementation for the SAE Brazil Aerodesign competition. AVL  was used to do Aerodynamic Analysis. Structural estimates are done based on the last competition edition. Performance analysis are done with basic equations from Anderson's books. 

Along with the script is a sample Airfoil and AVL.

There is no input yet. You can only input how many GA generations will run. 

After run is done, results are saved in a csv and shown in a plot. All the wings from the last generation will stay on the folder, ordered by score, so you can open them with AVL for inspection and use. 

To-do list:
- Translate everything to English
- Comment everything
- Beatiful GUI
- Clean code
- Structural Optimization
